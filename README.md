# Pomace

Building a custom controller board for our family's pomace boiler. 

What the board will need to control:
 - motor to get pomace into the fire (according to light sensor and thermometer)
 - fan motor which blows air into the flame (according to light sensor and thermometer)
 - motors bring water from the house (controlled by termometer and requests in the house)
 - motor to bring pomace into pyramidal storage (according to a light/fullness sensor to be installed)
 - motor to crunch pomace and bring it to the larger storage (user-actioned, but must add a protection against stalling)
 - heat gun turn on/off (maybe)

Sensors the board will have to process:
 - Water temperature
 - Waste gas temperature
 - Temperature of the waters going through the house (sanitary hot water)
 - Temperature insde the house
 - Flame light
 - Fullness of pyramid storage 
 - Stalling of the motors (especially the pomace breaker)

Material needed:
 - Arduino board
 - Screen
 - A bunch of
