# Pomace

Building a custom controller board for our family's pomace boiler. 













 - Temperature insde the house (A2)
 - Waste gas temperature (A3)
 - Flame light (A4)
 - Fullness of pyramid storage 
 - Stalling of the motors (especially the pomace breaker)

Components Required:

 - 4 Additional Temperature sensors https://mauser.pt/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=1667_2669_2676&products_id=096-8756 [BOUGHT]
 - 4 4.7 Ohm resistors to use with temperatrure sensor https://mauser.pt/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=324_526_530&products_id=104-7594 [BOUGHT]
 - 10K Ohm, 100K Ohm resistors [BOUGHT]
 - Buttons of some sort [BOUGHT]
 - Flame sensor  [BOUGHT, need a more heavy duty one]
 - SD Card Module and SD Card
 - Dimmer module



Interrupts
 - Needed for menus
 - Needed for motor control/dimmer

Web server should be able to:
 - Show the present state of the boiler
 - Provide controls for motors

Data Storage:
 - Timestamp from clock
 - Stored into SD card

 Motor control:
 - I think I can afford to spare one interrupt pin for the dimmer
 - I need to control the speed of an AC single-phase motor
 - 50 Hz, 220 V, 0.09 kW, 2800 RPM

Next Steps:
 - Program the entire logic of the boiler control
 - Add a screen and buttons (by this time the boiler can be controlled by the arduino)
